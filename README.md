# UIAutomationJS

## Introduction

**Automation** is a awesome feature of **Instruments**, but the build-in code editor doesn't support autocompletion. So I created the repo.

This Repo is just a javascript code stub, all the implementations are empty, it just tells the editor how many _build-in_ classes are there, and

 how does them inherit from others.

## Usage

1. Open **[WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/)** `Preferences` => `Languages & Frameworks` => `JavaScropt` => `Libraries`
   
    ![Preference](https://github.com/rickytan/UIAutomationJS/blob/screenshot/images/s0.png?raw=true)
   
2. Click **Add** button on the right, input _name_, then click **+** to **Attach Directories**
   
    ![Custom Library](https://github.com/rickytan/UIAutomationJS/blob/screenshot/images/s1.png?raw=true)
   
3. Click **OK**
   
4. And finally, don't forget to **Enable** it in your _UI Test_ project.
   
    ![Enable](https://github.com/rickytan/UIAutomationJS/blob/screenshot/images/s2.png?raw=true)

Now is should work!
